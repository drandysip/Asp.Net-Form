# Asp.Net-Form
An example Darl Form viewer for Asp.Net
This is a simple ASP.Net viewer for DarlForms connecting to the Darl web service. 

To use it you must supply your Subscription Key, obtainable from the [Darl Portal](https://darlinf.portal.azure-api.net/) under your profile and the map id for the form you want to use, obtainable from the main editing page.

You need to register to get these. It's free [here](https://darlinfsupport.azurewebsites.net/Account/Register) and rate-limited usage sufficient to run a demo is free too. 

In this example the index page will ask for the two ids. In a real website instance you would put them into the Settings.

The example is exceedingly plain vanilla, but you should be able to adapt it to suit your needs easily.
